# Post Stroke Epilepsy
This repository contains analysis notebook and data for my paper published in 2023: \
https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2023.1273270/full \
The project initially was a longitudinal one-hospital cohort study performed by a team of neurologists but then abandoned. \
I prepared the analysis and the publication as a side project while working as a Data Scientist at the Moscow Research and Neuropsychiatry Center.

While analyzing this dataset, I also prepared a review paper on post-stroke epilepsy, published: \
https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2023.1273270/full

The notebook includes data preprocessing, univariable and multivariable tests, survival analysis, predictor identification. \
Cox PH Model and Fine & Grey Model for long-term outcomes; logistic regression for short-term outcomes.
